INTERN ID:CT04DF1721
DOMAIN:Artificial intellegence
DURATION:4 weeks
MENTOR:Neela santhosh
DESCRIPTION:
The objective of this task is to develop a Speech Recognition System that can accurately convert spoken language into written text. This system serves as an example of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies can be applied to improve human-computer interaction.
The Speech Recognition System enables users to speak into a microphone, and the system processes the audio to display the recognized text in real time. It also handles errors such as unrecognized speech or connectivity issues gracefully. Additionally, the system maintains a log file of all recognized speech for reference.
